          <p>
            Push Pop is a system for pushing web pages from your mobile device
            and having them pop open in your desktop browser. See it in action!

        <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Your desktop browser of choice (just Google Chrome for now) runs
            the Push Pop extension, which listens for pages pushed from its
            partner bookmarklet.
          </p>

          <p>
            You use the bookmarklet from your mobile device and voil√†, when you
            return to your desk the pages you've pushed are right there waiting
            for you.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Where Can I Get It?</h2>
        <section class="downloads">
          <p>
            Push Pop is packaged as a browser extension. The bookmarklet is
            provided from the extension's options page. You can download the
            extension for your favorite browser using the links below.

        <h2>Still Unsassified?</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What kind of web pages would I use this for?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            A Flash (gasp!) game, perhaps. Any video that's longer than 60
            seconds. Maybe a long form that you need to fill out. Or a Google
            Spreadsheet that needs editing. Pretty much anything that sucks to
            do on a phone.
          </p>

          <h3>Isn't this like Chrome/Safari's tab syncing?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Yes and no. Yes in that it links pages from your mobile device to
            your desktop browser. No in that Push Pop is an interrupt-based
            system, whereas tab syncing is a poll-based system. Also, Push Pop
            is mobile browser agnostic and open source.
          </p>

          <h3>Why doesn't it work with Firefox, Safari, or Opera?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Mostly because I'm a Chrome user. However, I'll gladly add other
            browsers if somebody wants to contribute extensions for them. The
            extensions should all be very similar and can use my Chrome version
            as a reference.
          </p>

          <h3>Why is there a server side component?</h3>
          <p class="answer">
            Because it's the best way I could figure out to make it work. The
            good news is that the codebase is completely open source so you know
            the server isn't doing anything shady with the pages you're push
            popping.
